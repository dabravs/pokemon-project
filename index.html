                    In the original Generation 1 Pokémon games released in 1998, the developers included a total of 151 
                    Pokémon belonging to 15 different types. These types ranged from the three Pokémon starter types of Water, 
                    Grass, and Fire all the way to rarer types like Ghost or Dragon types.

                    In Pokémon, each of the game's titular Pocket Monsters can have up to two types. 
                    As a result, Gen 1 has several dual typed Pokémon.
